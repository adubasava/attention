# Analysis

## Layer 6, Head 2

The head appears to be paying attention to relationship between **a verb** and **a preposition that follows the verb** and either modifies its meaning (cf. pick and pick up), either is just common for that verb (wait for). If to change the order of the words so that there are other words between a verb and a preposition the relationship becomes less important.

Example Sentences:
- Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table. Then I picked a [MASK] up from the table.
- They are waiting for a [MASK].

## Layer 6, Head 10

Here the head is paying attention to three relationships: between **a determiner** (the, a) and **a noun**; between **the subject** (masked) and its **action**; between **a possessive pronoun** and **a noun**. I intentionally increased the distance between the subject and the action in the second sentence (by inserting an adverb): the relationship retains but again becomes less important.

Example Sentences:
- The [MASK] hugged their dog.
- A [MASK] suddenly opened my door.
